The Docker runner is dual licensed under [Polyform-Small-Business-1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/small-business/1.0.0) and [Polyform-Free-Trial-1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/free-trial/1.0.0). You choose the license that best suits your needs.


The Polyform licenses are source available licenses that grant some, but not all rights to use the software. The Kubernetes runner is free for individuals and small business with under 1,000,000 USD annual revenue and under 100 employees. Larger organizations are granted a 32 day free trial.
